# Cycling GPS Data
Analysis of some data derived from a cycling GPS computer that records a number of variables at regular intervals during a race.  We are provided with nine files in the GPX XML format. The files are all in the same format and represent the cyclist riding the same race course (at Lansdowne Park in Sydney) at different times.

## Outcome
* Finding average speed of the rider.
* Plotting a histogram showing the distribution of speed over the course of the race.
* Plotting speed vs gradient for the race.
* How many laps the rider complete in the race.
* Tabulating the average speeds of the races and the date of each race.
* Plotting speed vs date.
* For each race tabulating the fastest and slowest lap times.

# Update Logs
* Plot descriptions added.
* Confusing parts of some plots have been cleared.
* More comments added.
* Unnecessary codes have been cleared.
